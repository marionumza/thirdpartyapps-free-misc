Server Environment
==================

Lets you define various server environments, relate it with partners,
write details of those environments: like number of users, databases,
server resources etc.

Can define machine template that holds common resources for all machine
instances so it is more convenient to manage and create new machines.

Can log planned/done changes for machines to always know what was done.

Can use groups to group machines having same purpose (e.g. testing
machines, production machines etc.). Using same groups, can inform
related partners about planned changes, where mail is automatically
generated according to what is planed to be done and then sent to
needed recipients.
