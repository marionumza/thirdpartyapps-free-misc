======================
 WhatsApp Integration
======================

The module allows creating a WhatsApp bot to communicate with people through Odoo.

For each WhatsApp user, the module creates a partner with corresponding information (name, nickname, avatar).

Free API
========

There is a *free* alternative to the `Chat API <https://chat-api.com/>`_:

* https://github.com/itpp-labs/whatsapp-api-service
* https://github.com/itpp-labs/whatsapp-api

It requires extra efforts on deploying as well as on development. Contact us if you want to try this game.
